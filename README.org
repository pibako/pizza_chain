#+TITLE: Pizza Chain README
#+OPTIONS:   toc:nil

* Objective
** Requirements
   The following requirements should be met:
   - It should work.
   - It should contain detailed instructions about how to run the program.
   - It should contain automated tests.
   - It should be simple yet extensible.

** Description
   The client owns a pizza chain, and needs an application to manage
   the menus. Each pizza restaurant has a unique name, address and
   hours of service. In each pizzeria there may be many types of
   pizza. Each pizza has a name, price and ingredients (as a
   description). The task is to write a simple application for
   managing restaurants and types of pizza available in them. The
   layout is not important, as long as itâ€™s simple and clean.

* Prerequisites
  To run this app you must have:
  - ruby version 1.9.3-p448 installed (I personally prefer to use
    rbenv but rvm is also fine).
  - sqlite3 (usually available by default on any platform)
* Installation
  Get the app from my github account:
  : $ git clone https://github.com/pibako/pizza_chain.git
  : $ cd pizza_chain
  and execute ~boundle install~ command:
  : $ bundle install
* Bootstrap
  First setup database
  : $ bundle exec rake db:setup
  Then test it:
  : $ bundle exec rake
  I usually use guard for continuous testing:
  : $ bundle exec guard -i
  All tests should be green now.
* Usage
  Start server locally:
  : $ rails s
  and go to http://localhost:3000
** Public area:
   You should see list of pizzerias with links to see more details
   about each. At the top of the page you can find link to admin area.
** Admin area:
   Admin pages are delivered using ActiveAdmin (to write my own
   administration framework I consider a waste of time). Go to
   http://localhost:3000/admin and login with the following
   credentials:
   - email: ~pizza@chain.com~
   - password: ~pizzachain~
   You can easily manage restaurants and pizzas.
